### Prompts to develop my understanding of webcomponents
this sqeuence of prompts are used to try and help me grasp a better understanding of how the structure of a shadowDOM should be within a webcomponent.

> hello i have a question about web components and best practises, I was wondering what is a standard way of defining shadow DOMs within JavaScript in a readable format, I was wondering if it was a good idea to use a template and then load it into the web component or define the structure within the web component its self

chatgpt response was that both are vaild ways of creating shadowDOM however it says that templates are may make the code more readable.



The response was proved useless because the prompt wasn't specific enough about XYZ, so:

>  this is an example prompt given to a chatbot detailing XYZ
